Requirment ::

Build an Android application that allows a customer to enter text that will be treated as a "Tag". Tags should be saved to the device so they can be  viewed/edited at any  time. Text for a tag can contain alpha numeric characters  and no special characters.  

As a further requirement, your boss wants you to provide a library that can be  used in Android projects that would provide the following functionality:  

    1. Given a set of Tags, sort the Tags in ascending or descending order. 
    2. Given a set of Tags, determine the most frequently occurring Tag.

In your application, provide a second screen that provides the requirements below; customers should be able to navigate between screens at any time:  

    1. Displays all the stored Tags and shows a count of the Tags 
    2. Customer can perform an action to display Tags in ascending and/or descending order 
    3. Customer can perform an action that will duplicate the current set of Tags     1,000 times. Customer should see the count reflected accurately. 
    4. Customer can perform an action that will display the most frequently occurring     Tag when action is complete. While this is happening, the customer    should still be able to interact with the listing of all Tags.   

Application must support portrait and landscape orientations.  Application must run on Gingerbread and newer versions of Android.
